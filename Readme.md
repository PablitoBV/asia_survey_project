# Data Visualization Project: Political and Social Views of Southeast Asia

## Overview
This project involves visualizing a comprehensive dataset that explores the political and social views of individuals from 14 Southeast Asian countries. The dataset includes responses to 172 questions, primarily categorical, alongside socio-economic information. The goal of this project is to develop an array of visualizations to enhance understanding and analysis of the political landscape in the region.

To achieve this, we utilized various visualization techniques, such as histograms, heat maps, spider charts, and stacked area charts, to uncover trends and correlations within the data. These visualizations were created using HTML, JavaScript, and CSS, with D3.js playing a central role in providing interactivity and customization.

## Project Structure
- **Data**: The dataset consists of responses from individuals across 14 countries, with information spanning political views, socio-economic factors, and more.
- **Visualizations**: Various charts and maps were implemented to present different aspects of the dataset, including country comparisons, socio-economic insights, and temporal analysis.

## Technologies Used:
- **HTML, CSS, JavaScript**: For structuring and styling the front-end interface.
- **D3.js**: To implement interactive visualizations like heatmaps, histograms, spider charts, and stacked area charts.

## Running the Code

### Steps to Run the Project Locally:
1. **Extract the Dataset**: Inside the repository, locate and extract the mergeddata.zip file. This will unpack the dataset as a CSV file, which is essential for the visualizations.
2. **Start the Project**:
   - Open the repository in your preferred code editor (e.g., VSCode).
   - Start LiveServer (or LiveView) from the editor to launch the project.
   - Open the file `mainpage.html` in your browser to load the main page of the visualization.

## Navigating the project
#### Main Page
This is the entry point for the project, displaying an overview of the dataset. Click on the buttons on top of the page to view different visualizations. Choose the feature you want to view by using the navigators, or the tab interface on the right side of the page. Filter you visualization by clicking on the map to select/unselect countries. Filter the considered time by clicking on the date buttons.

### Other Pages
Other visualizations can be accessed from the main page in the Other visualizations sections.

- **First Visualization**: The first visualization presents a heatmap of specific questions. Choose the question you want to visualize from the dropdonw. Hover on the heatmap for more information. View the statistics of "non-answers" in the histogram below the heatmap.

- **Second Visualization**: The second visualiztion presents a spider chart of the socio-economic factors of each country. Select the country you want to view from the dropdown. Further information is provided on the page itself.

- **Third Visualization**: The third visualization presents a stacked area chart of the aggregated answers of the respondents per socio-economic factor over time. Choose the question and the socio-economic factor you want to plot from the tab on the right hand side.
